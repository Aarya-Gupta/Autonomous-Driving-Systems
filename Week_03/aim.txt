1. Forget about the notion of steering angle. Now, consider there is only one angle, heading angle; which will be
changed at every time stamp to modify the direction of the vehicle. 

The New system equations are :
x(t) = x(t-Δt) + v * cos(θ(t)) * Δt
y(t) = y(t-Δt) + v * sin(θ(t)) * Δt
θ(t) = θ(t-Δt) + Δθ(t)

Now, just for the first iteration/time stamp, we are assuming Δθ(t) to be a R.V. which is following a Gaussian (0, 1)
distribution. On the basis of this change in θ, aim is to find the distribution of x(t) and y(t).

Now, can I modify the distribution (which was used to extract the value of Δθ(t)), on the basis of the value of Δθ(t)
extracted. This would be my revised distribution, which will be used to find the value of Δθ(t+Δt). Use this Δθ(t+Δt) 
to find x(t+Δt) and y(t+Δt). Now, this series of updating the distribution has to be done for a large no. of observations,
so that an approximate revised distribution of x, y, Δθ can be obtained.

Now, if distribution of x, y, Δθ are some common distribution, then plot their other statistical charachters; like cdf, 
mean, variance, etc.


2. A similar task as above is to be done for coin being tossed (theoretical analysius of this scenario will be used in 
simulating some aspects of ADS). Suppose that for the 1st toss of coin, the observation is derived/taken from some 
common distribution say Uniform distribution. Now, once a value is derived from the distribution, then try to modify 
this distribution on the basis of the value derived. This task of updating the distribution is to be done for a large 
no. of coin tosses in order to refine the distribution.
