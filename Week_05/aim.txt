1. Compare the o/p  of KDE with bootstrapping, with a constant data set used as the initial change in heading angle.
2. It's not necessary that same size of list is to be sampled again from the bootstrapping. Size of the list can be variable.
In actual, we are just trying to test it; so the size of the newly sampled list can be variable.
